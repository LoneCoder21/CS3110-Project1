Code to recognize floating point literals
We use 4 NFA's but since DFA's are equivalent to NFA'S it is bascially the union of 4 NFA's converted to one DFA. Which proves that our code works.
This implementation uses standard switch statements/ if statements to parse through the string, and simulate a DFA.
